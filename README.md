# ü§ù PeerTECH Web

[PeerTECH](https://collabrh.com/peertech) is a peer and technology-supported self-management intervention that teaches adults with a lived experience of a mental health condition on how to co-manage psychiatric illness and chronic health conditions. 

This web app serves as the admin portal for the PeerTECH platform. It enables super-admins and admins to access information about participating organizations' service users, peers, and chats while modifying surveys and resources libraries. It also allows new peer/user accounts to be created and admins to be assigned.

DALI is partnering with Dartmouth psychiatry professor Karen Fortuna, creator of the [Digital Peer Support](https://collabrh.com) project under which PeerTECH falls, to rebuild and expand on previous versions of the PeerTECH mobile app and admin portal.

## Architecture
### Tech Stack ü•û

The entire app is built in React, with add-ons like webpack, Babel, and Sass

Global state is managed with [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and routing is handled by [React-Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom).

We are using Google's [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for storage and Google's [Identity Platform](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform) for authentication.

Please check out [the wiki](https://github.com/dali-lab/peertech-web/wiki) before getting started for things to note about the app's structure and functionality. We will do our best to keep it up to date!

## Branches, Development and Deployment

We have been developing new features on the `development` branch, and pushing to the `master` branch to create a new release. The app on the `development` branch uses a separate Google Firestore account and database from our production database. 

We're using local environment variables to connect to our dev/prod databases. If you need any of the configuration variables for firebase, they are available on the firebase developer console, as well as accessible through the netlify settings for the sites. 

The development website is live on Netlify at https://peertech-dev.netlify.app/

The production website is live on Netlify at https://peertech.netlify.app/.

Our repo is setup for automatic deployment with netlify. Pushing to the `develop` branch will deploy to our dev site and pushing to the `master` branch will deploy to the production site.
